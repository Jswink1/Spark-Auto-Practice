This is a practice ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Application that simulates a service 
for an Auto Shop to store and display data on Customers, Cars, and services performed.

Concepts that I have learned and implemented into this Razor Pages Application include:

- ASP.NET Core Razor Pages Framework
- Entity Framework Core
- ASP.NET Identity
- Pagination
- Route Parameters and URL Parameters
- Custom Tag Helpers
- Sending Emails with SendGrid
- View Components
- Validation
- Bind Properties
- Async/Await
- External Login with Facebook
